# Rock, Paper, Scissors!
"Rock, Paper, Scissors!" is a website for people who want to play the famous Rock, Paper, Scissors game against a computer.

The purpose of "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" is to be a short distraction from the daily lives of their users.
This is achieved by presenting a very easy to follow webpage with an attractive design.

## Design
A minimalistic but attractive design was chosen, there is no need for a substantial layout change based on the device where it is viewed.
- __Wireframes__
    - Wireframe was generated by hand to show the planned layout.

- __Colors__
    - The colors used for "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" were inspired by the 1980s with flashy colors that are easy on the eyes. The Background color of the "Ties" box is the combination of the background colors of Player and CPU and is considered an Easter Egg.
