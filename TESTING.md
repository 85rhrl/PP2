# Rock, Paper, Scissors! - Testing
Tests were done on smartphones running Android and iOS, on a 15" screen laptop using Chrome, Firefox and Safari as well as on a 32" monitor.

The display of the different elements was checked on different devices and adjustments were carried out in HTML and CSS.
One example was the presentation of the 3 possible options (Rock, Paper and Scissors) on devices with a small screen such as the iPhone 5; the screen is not wide enough to properly present the 3 options on a single line. Flexbox was chosen as a possible solution and now the 3 options can be presented on different lines as seen on the following image:
